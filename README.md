## Centava ðŸ‘‹


Centava automates configuration management between the kernel and edge to allow intelligent edge caching, offloading, inference and training. Centava provides an edge configuration system scripting tool that interfaces with Puppet, an automated administrative engine for Linux, Unix, and Windows systems to offload administrative tasks based on a centralized specification, allowing the edge to operate in asynchronous fashion.
